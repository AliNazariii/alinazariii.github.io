My name is Ali Nazari, and I'm about to graduate with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the [Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)](https://aut.ac.ir/en). My thesis recently started, and I'm working on generating Persian poetry using deep neural networks. Before that, I joined our university's natural language understanding (NLU) lab, and I was working on a machine translation project about detecting the meter of Persian poems. I achieved outstanding results, and I plan to publish them soon. Besides my academic efforts, I have some industrial experiences too. Previously, I was a software developer, but now I work as a machine learning engineer in [Bale Messenger](https://bale.ai/). I'm responsible for designing and developing a chatbot to answer our customers' financial questions automatically.
