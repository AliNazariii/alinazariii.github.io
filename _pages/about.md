I'm Ali Nazari, a Computer Engineering graduate from [Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amirkabir_University_of_Technology) in Tehran, Iran. My profound passion for technology, research, and problem-solving has driven me to explore various facets of computer science, ranging from software engineering and machine learning to deep learning and computer networks.

Throughout my academic journey, I delved into diverse research areas, including mobile network optimization techniques and the development of drive test solutions. Furthermore, I immersed myself in the intricate world of Persian poetry, where I meticulously curated datasets, designed models for Persian poem [meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_metres) detection, and even ventured into the realm of Persian poetry generation using deep neural networks.

In my professional career, I've been fortunate to engage in stimulating projects, tackling large-scale [messaging applications](https://www.linkedin.com/company/balemessenger/) with complex system challenges and contributing to the innovation of [Divar](https://www.linkedin.com/company/divarofficial/), Iran's premier online classified ads platform, aimed at enhancing user experiences.

With a robust foundation in programming, data analysis, critical thinking, and an unwavering commitment to staying on the cutting edge of technology, I am enthusiastic about continuing my journey of exploration and innovation within the dynamic field of computer science.

Beyond my technical prowess, I hold a strong dedication to knowledge sharing and community engagement. My leadership role as the Chairman of the [Students' Scientific Chapter of CE department of AUT](https://github.com/CEIT-SSC) allowed me to organize an array of educational events, fostering a vibrant culture of learning and collaboration.
