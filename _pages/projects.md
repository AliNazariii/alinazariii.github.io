- Designed and developed a system for generating Persian poems inspired by the styles of classical Iranian poets like Hafez and Sa’di
- Fine‑tuned Generative Pre‑trained Transformer 2 (GPT‑2) to learn the art of poem generation

## [Message Broker](https://github.com/AliNazariii/message-broker)

- Implemented a scalable and highly available message broker system with Golang, supporting message management and routing between diverse clients
- Leveraged Postgresql and Cassandra for robust data persistence, ensuring secure storage and efficient retrieval
- Enhanced system monitoring and performance insights through the incorporation of basic logs and Prometheus metrics, allowing for rapid issue identification and resolution


<!-- ## [Digikala Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/AliNazariii/Digikala-Sentiment-Analysis)

NLP, Deep Learning, LSTM (Summer 2021)

- Predict whether a comment left in [Digikala](https://www.digikala.com/) is recommending a product or not.
- Used text classification methods and an LSTM model with fastai

## [Part of Speech Tagger](https://github.com/AliNazariii/Part-of-Speech-Tagger)

NLP, BERT (Winter 2021)

- A POS (Part-of-speech) tagger to grammatically classify tokens (noun, verb, adjective...) in a sentence.
- Used a pre-trained model name ParsBERT, a transformer-based Persian language understanding model, and a monolingual one based on Google's BERT model
- Fine-tuned with Bijankhan Persian Corpus

## [Iran Covid-19 Clusters](https://github.com/AliNazariii/Iran-Covid-Clusters)

ML, Clustering (Fall 2020)

- Used different clustering approaches like K-Means, DBScan, ...
